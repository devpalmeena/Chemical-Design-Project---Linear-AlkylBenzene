This report presents the manufacturing process of Linear Alkylbenzene(LAB). Chapter
 1describes the chemical, its physical and chemical properties, uses of LAB and by-products
 formed during its manufacturing. Chapter 2 deals with various mechanisms, production
 processes, and proposed routes that are involved. After a short description, the yield of
 different routes is described.
 Chapter 3 describes the challenges faced when using an old method and the ongoing
 research on it. Here, an overview of the global lab market of LAB is shown in terms of
 revenue. It provides an analysis of LAB-based products and their proportion in the
 market. It analyzes the size of this market for 14 years and the largest companies
 manufacturing it. At the end of this chapter, we have described that we are choosing
 Vadodara, Gujarat as the location for building the LAB production plant and the reasons
 behind it. Also, we have described the ideal plant capacity.
 In Chapter 4, we have described the manufacturing process of LAB, taking Kerosene
 as our raw feed, inlet. This process can be split into two subprocesses, first the Front
 end process, which is the conversion of Kerosene into straight paraffin of the required
 carbons, i.e., 10 to 14. Then, the Back end process, deals with the conversion of that
 straight paraffin into LAB. The whole process is described with process flow diagrams.
 In Chapter 5, we have done mass balance on reactors and separation columns. Mass
 of different components is shown in tabular form. Mass balance of the back end is
 shown.
 In Chapter 6, simulation results of the complete backend process has been described.
 This is followed by comparison between results obtained from manual calculation and
 the simulation report.
 In Chapter 7, we have described the results after doing sensitivity analysis for each
 equipment. This helps us in the choosing the right parameter to operate the equipments.
